# Feather Fury

**Feather Fury** is a cyberpunk-inspired, side-scrolling action game built entirely in vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Glide, dodge, and dash through a neon cityscape in a fast-paced race against time. This project is a from-scratch remake using best practices and advanced patterns, redesigned with a futuristic pixel-art vibe and original cybernetic obstacles.
